![Cisco Logo](assets/cisco.png "Cisco logo") Network Scripts
===============================

This repository contains a set of scripts for configuring your Cisco switches
and routers.

The creation of these scripts has been done during the various CCNA training
courses offered by Cisco, using [Packet
Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer-download/), a network
simulation and visualization tool. Therefore, some commands may need to be
modified on real hardware.

The scripts are composed in two formats:
*  Text file (.txt): the current script to copy and paste in your routers or switches.
*  Markdown file (.md): brief summary of the commands and values used for the script.

It should be noted that sometimes within the different folders there is another
folder called "troubleshooting" which allows you to check the correct
configuration of your routers and switches.

### Supported Features ###

Here is a list of features configurable by the scripts created in this
repository.

```
 basic               ➔ basic configuration for routers and switches
 eigrp               ➔ advanced distance-vector routing protocol
 etherchannel        ➔ port link aggregation technology or port-channel architecture used primarily on Cisco switches
 glbp                ➔ Cisco proprietary protocol that attempts to overcome the limitations of existing redundant router protocols
 hsrp                ➔ Cisco redundancy protocol for establishing a fault-tolerant default gateway
 ospf                ➔ routing protocol for Internet Protocol networks
 routes              ➔ static IPv4 and IPv6 routes
 serial              ➔ serial link configuration (clock, rate, bandwidth, ...)
 spanning-tree       ➔ network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks
 ssh                 ➔ cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network
```
